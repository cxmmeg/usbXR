usbXR - Low cost USB Wireless transceiver
=========================================

usbXR is basically a USB adapter for the RFM75 2.4GHz wireless module. The USB functionlity is implemented using AVR ATmega328 and the (v-usb)[https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html] firmware-only USB driver for AVRs, which emulates USB low-speed protocol. The device can be used for bi-directional communication with *remote* nodes, containing the same wireless module (ie. RFM75 or other compatible modules like RFM70/RFM73).


Hardware
--------

The hardware is simple and can only cost as low as 5 USD to make. (hardware)[https://github.com/visakhanc/usbXR/hardware] folder contains the eagle schematic and layout with Partlist.
